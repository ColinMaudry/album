Shell script reads a directory tree of images, creates a parallel tree of
thumbnail images, preview images, and static html page views all linked
together.  The script actually generates XML pages.  Use provided XSL and CSS
stylesheets to generate and style the HTML.

The www directory contains a few odd sample pictures for testing.

Usage:

Invoke gallery.sh with three arguments-
- the first is the common root for the (existing) directory of photos and
  the (existing or to be) directory of gallery files
- the second is the source directory of images, relative to first
- the third is the destination directory name, relative to the first

For example, './gallery.sh www photos album'

Next, run an XSL transform of the XML files in the result, album
directory.  Use
- the build.xml script if you have ant
- the transform.sh script if you have Xalan Java
- the c-transform.sh script if you have Xalan C

For example, './c_transform.sh style/site.xsl www album'

Finally, point your browser to www/album/index.html
